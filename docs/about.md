# About Dasset
`Dasset™ | algobet Labs © 2017`

`Dasset` is a digital asset system with an omni digital asset format and unit to quantify the value of the digital world.

A typical atomic `dasset` is composed of identify (ID), ownership (ON), value (VL), underlying (UL), reference (RF), etc., each of which has specific data structure.

As essential part of the `Dasset` ecosystem, a cluster of blockchain OTT applications include account domain systems (blockstack), identity domain systems (quarkonium), value simulators (quarkonium), transformation tools (bao@ethereum), value repository systems (bas@ipfs), plugin toolkits (allbot), etc.


## Methodology

`Dasset` builds a federal system in the digital world with constitutional facilities. Three technologies are employed to develop the proof of concept (`POC`) oriented methodology: 

### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
`DLT` is adopted as fundamental mechanism to run the systems.

### Over The Top (OTT)
`OTT` is another technology to formulate and diversify the ecosystem.

### Offline To Online (O2O)
`O2O` is also the operational methodology to enrich the ecosystem.


## Proof of Concept

DLT implementation is the master proof of concept of `Dasset`. OTT deployment of proof of concepts deepens the ecosystem. O2O instances of proof of concepts widen the ecosystem.

### Role Taking
`Dasset` system has the boundary and is connected to the real world by "account", "underlying" and/or "reference". Each role has an account.

### Internet of Value
`Dasset` objectizes the digital asset in an omni simulator and breaks down them into `dasset` and `bud` which are quantifiable and transferrable.


## Development

### Teams
- Distributed collaboration via face2face meetups in New York City, City of London, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, etc.
- Remote slack and other agreed channels for working communication.
